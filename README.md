# Attractor dynamics for networks with learning rules inferred from in vivo data

This repository contains three directories:

1. Dynamics
2. CapacityFung
3. MaximalCapacity
 

# Dynamics
It contains the code for reproducing Fig 6 A-F. 
By changing the value of the parameter A results on Fig 3 and Fig 4 A are also reproduced.

For generating fig4.pdf, first run `python main.py` on the `numeric/network_simulation` directory. The simulation
will take a couple of hours depending on your machine.

# CapacityFung
It contains the code for reproducing Fig 4 B-C. 
The same code can be used to perform the parmeter exploration described in the paper
for generating Fig 5.

# MaximalCapacity
It contains the code for reproducing S7.
