# Attractor dynamics for networks with learning rules inferred from in vivo data

This repository contains three directories:

1. Dynamics
2. CapacityFung
3. MaximalCapacity
 
 These directories contain the necessary code to reproduce most the figures of
the paper by just changing parameters or making slight modficiations.

# Dynamics
This directory contains the code that reproduces Fig 6 A-F  of the paper. 
By changing the value of A results on Fig 3 and Fig 4 A  also are reproduced.

# CapacityFung
This directory contains the code that reproduces Fig 4 B-C  of the paper. 
Fig 5 can be generating by using the same code to perform the parmeter exploration described in the paper.

# MaximalCapacity
This directory contains the code that reproduces S7.
